## About

Deep Learning Specialization from Coursera. Include courses on MLP, CNN, RNN, GRU, LSTM and Transformer Networks.

*Note: Jupyter notebook doesn't contain helper functions and images, thus they are incomplete. The goal of this repo is for me to keep a trace of the work achieved on this subject and to have an easy way to access these ressources*
